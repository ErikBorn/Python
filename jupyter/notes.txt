Scatter with the bands clearly labelled

New stuff (9/8/25)
Take the cohort data, add a slider by percentile that allows us to "fit" the data, with a +/- percentage graphically drawn
Can we then flag the "underliers" and then sum those differences to get them on to the band?

Steps:
1. Figure out how to come up with a number from the percentile of our cohort data (need to move the data into Python I think)
2. Get these graphed with an adjustable percentage range
3. Add in the slider
4. Make sure we can then use the interactive plot, even if it's disjointed
