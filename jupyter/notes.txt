Catagories for faculty: Teaching faculty, teaching assistants, non-instructional teachers, administrative
Other factors: Skill rating, Catagory ^, 

Scatter with the bands clearly labelled

Next steps:
    Add in the catagories, clean up skill ratings
    Run the models again
    Sub-charts for different catagories (TAs)

New stuff (9/8/25)
Take the cohort data, add a slider by percentile that allows us to "fit" the data, with a +/- percentage graphically drawn
Can we then flag the "underliers" and then sum those differences to get them on to the band?
