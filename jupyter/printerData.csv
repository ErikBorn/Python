You are welcome to have it placed in one the ""closets"" off the Maker Space!!","In an effort to be more environmentally friendly, we should consider the printers that require a badge tap to print, that keep track of how much paper we use"

12/16/2024 11:58:24,High School,HS Library,3,I am not only a user but I help make sure that the printer is stocked with paper and toner.  Ordering toner is really easy.,More adults (teachers) need to be trained on how to troubleshoot the printers.  Seems like the issues get left for the next user.   ,I like how we make the student printing process a multi step process.   They can't just print from their laptops.  It has really saved on paper usage.

You are all my heroes!
12/16/2024 12:07:19,High School,HS Faculty Lounge,2,There are so many good features for hole punching and stapling.  I also really like the scanning feature.,I would love to be able to set any feature from my laptop instead of having to make a print and then set the features.  I would also love to be able to easily find my name in the printer for scanning so I don't have to enter it every time.,The printer has been having quite a bit of trouble and a quick lesson on how we can easily troubleshoot would be nice.  I do feel like I am trying to troubleshoot more often recently.

I print to Sarah P's desk, then copy on the big printer. Would like it if the color printer could double-side. Would like to be able to print from home.","Students (in middle school) are under the impression that they can't print. I'm not sure if this is true or not, but if they need to print (which admittedly isn't very often, at least for my class or interactions with them), they email docs to me and I print for them, which feels pretty inefficient. I agree that they probably don't need to print much, and maybe a teacher should have to ""approve"" print jobs or something to avoid waste, but going thru the teacher seems dumb."

12/16/2024 12:46:00,Lower School,"LS Faculty Lounge, LS Office (Jackie)",5,"I love the speed of the faculty room printer, and its capability to collate and staple books.  The color printer is another story.  See below.","The colored printer is SLOW, and the print quality is never great.  It also is a major pain if cardstock needs to be used, which for me, is often.  It jams, doesn't print clearly, and is an overall hassle.  I also wish we could print in color larger than 8x11.","Nope, that should do it.  Thanks!"

12/16/2024 13:35:43,Middle School,"MS Faculty Lounge, MS Office (Sarah)",2,Scans and prints quickly; love the staple feature and double-sided feature.,"I would love a booklet/pamphlet feature--print, staple, fold a 8.5x11 into a booklet. We would LOVE a rainbow of copy paper in the middle school (could enhance learning and organization for students to have handouts in various colors). I would print more in color if it was available, but I get the sense that we reserve color printing for whenever necessary.","As the language arts teacher, it is laborious for me to have students print their own work. Their iPads are not connected to a printer, so if I want them to print a paper copy, they have to share the document with me, and then I send it to the printer. Then, I ask the student to pick it up from the main office which can be annoying to Sarah Powell. I wonder if student iPads could be connected to a printer and allowed to print themselves. (However, that would still mean that students would go to the office for their papers.) Or could the sixth-grade pod have a printer in the pod or in one of our classrooms? Even if students had to share their documents with a teacher, they could pick up their work without bugging Sarah. Adding permission for students to print and/or adding a printer in the sixth grade pod would be really helpful! "

12/16/2024 14:57:57,Middle School,MS Faculty Lounge,3,"I really appreciate how reliable the Kyocera TASKalfa 7003i in the middle school faculty lounge is for my printing needs. It handles large print jobs efficiently, and the print quality is consistently excellent, especially for the black-and-white classwork and homework handouts I use frequently. The speed and ease of use make it a valuable tool in keeping up with my teaching materials. Thank you for maintaining such a dependable resource for us!","While I’m generally very happy with the Kyocera TASKalfa 7003i, a couple of improvements would make my printing experience even better. It would be helpful if the printer had an option for a 'favorites' or 'quick settings' menu to save frequently used print preferences like black-and-white, double-sided, or specific paper sizes. Additionally, ensuring the printer trays are always stocked with the appropriate paper would help avoid interruptions during busy times. If possible, quicker troubleshooting or clearer error messages, when there's a paper jam or toner issue, would also be a great improvement!","Thank you for taking the time to gather our feedback! In addition to the suggestions I’ve shared, I’d like to mention that having regular updates about toner levels or maintenance schedules for the Kyocera printer would be helpful. This way, we can avoid unexpected downtime during peak usage. I really appreciate all the work the IT department does to keep things running smoothly!"
12/16/2024 15:14:23,Sanders House,SH Advancement,5,That they exist,"The Advancement printer is not up to standards for what Marcom/Advancement uses it for. We use often for designed pieces and need a heavy duty printer. It should be able to: staple, staple in the binding, hole punch, print at high capacity, scan at high quality.","This is Kerra; I have a lot of opinions on printers and happy to share. Also, the printer is in a weird place. Is there a better location where we would not bother Advancement every time we need to print. They also end up being the ones who trouble shoot basic things.
