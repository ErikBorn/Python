David: "If you want to use an object relational mapper in Python, 
it’s pretty good stuff to learn. I’d look into sqlalchemy

Not particularly difficult if your just using SQLite 
That doesn’t require a server at all

Postgres and psycopg2 if you want to interact directly with it without an ORM
I use pgAdmin for the UI if I need it"

Goals:
-- Continue working on .groupby
-- Collect all activity data with APIs
-- Build activity data into a database...?
-- Pull MFP data into database
-- Generate some new interesting stuff using this data, ideas:
    - Try to figure out Power vs. HR vs. Elevation vs. Time (?)

-- NLP on gmail outbox for life event tagging
